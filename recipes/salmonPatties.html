    <h2>Description </h2>
    <p>  This is such an easy recipe that I can throw together super fast at the end of a long, hard day. It packs a punch of flavor with very little effort. My kids love this and request it often. Sometimes, I even make a few extra to go in their lunch boxes the next day.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil, or as needed</li>
        <li> 2 (5 ounce) cans salmon, drained and flaked</li>
        <li>2 eggs </li>
        <li> ½ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup green bell pepper, diced </li>
        <li>¼ cup green onions, diced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat sesame oil in skillet over medium heat until it bubbles around the tip of a spoon when dipped in.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix salmon, eggs, panko, bell pepper, green onions, ginger, soy sauce, sesame seeds, and five-spice powder together in a bowl. Form mixture into patties and set, evenly spaced, into the hot oil in the skillet.


        </li>
        <li>
            Brown patties, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and brown on the other side, 4 to 5 minutes more. Remove patties from pan and drain on a paper-towel lined plate to drain excess oil.
